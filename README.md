# QRAM
Quantum Random Access Memory is storage device for quantum states. Herein we have implemented the version Giovannetti et al., for details look at the jupyter notebook. Our QRAM can be used as a state prepration(encoding data) for various algorithm which have been implemented using QISKIT. Projects utilitzing QuEST can also use .cpp file.
